## MEN MVC

MEN MVC is a wrapper framework built on top of Express JS to make web API development with MongoDB, Express and Node much more efficient, time-saving, and organised by providing you with an application where development architecture and necessary components to build an API are already set up in favour of MVC pattern as well as offering the additional built-in features such as authentication, caching, etc. MEN MVC is a wrapper framework for Express JS so knowledge of Express JS is required. It's using TypeScript so you must know TypeScript too.
